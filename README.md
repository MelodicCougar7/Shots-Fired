# Shots Fired
1.20.1 addon to have guns (currently only from tacz) drop empty casings when shot.

Currently intended only as a library of sorts for [DeceasedCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/deceasedcraft). 

ACTIVELY MAKING PROGRESS ON VPB IMPLEMENTATION. Stay tuned for a release!

Eventually will have default integration with [Create: Mass Munitions](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-mass-munitions) for casing drops. Will also eventually support all 3d model gun mods like VPB, GC:AA., JEG, Scorched, and more. Basically this mod will add casing drop functionality to any gun mod that doesn't already have it, one day.

Join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/MTdavMVTEr) to contact me, I'm very much open to adding default configuration for your mod or addon.
